# Prototype vs Implementation Gap Analysis
**Date:** 2025-11-12  
**Comparison:** `app-prototype.html` vs Current React Native Implementation

## Executive Summary
This document identifies ALL gaps between the HTML prototype (single source of truth) and the current React Native implementation, cross-referenced against the `# AppStats.md` checklist.

---

## Recent Updates (Social polish)

### Sprint 1 Completion Update
- Post Cards: video overlay, carousel arrows/dots, full action bar, for-sale overlays
- Create Post: visibility selector, outfit details (brand/occasion), marketplace fields, media grid, location/tags
- Profile Tabs: posts/liked/saved grids, comments list, overlays and empty states
- FAB badges: wired for cart, connections, messages
- DTOs normalized across feed/trending/suggestions; FE trending normalization for safety
- Search: Clear button and improved empty copy; user taps route to `/profile/[id]`, post taps to `/post/[id]`.
- Notifications: Gradient icon circles, Mark All as Read wired; realtime socket listener appends to list.
- Connections: Mutual badge/count styling added; per-filter empty states with CTA to discover people; backend integration for following, followers, and pending requests; loading skeletons.
- Chat: Online status dot styling fixed and used consistently in list and chat detail.

## ❌ CRITICAL GAPS (Blocking MVP)

### GAP 1: Bottom Sheets - 80% Missing
**Status:** Base component exists; a few core sheets are present

**Implemented/Updated (Structural — heights 60/95, handle, scroll):**
- ✅ MoreSheet (components/sheets/MoreSheet.tsx)
- ✅ ShareSheet (components/sheets/ShareSheet.tsx)
- ✅ SortFilterSheet (components/sheets/SortFilterSheet.tsx)
- ✅ RegistrationSheet (components/sheets/RegistrationSheet.tsx)
- ✅ PasswordResetSheet (components/sheets/PasswordResetSheet.tsx)

Notes:
- Additional prototype “sheets” (Rankings, Subscription, Themes, Edit Profile, Avatar Picker, Privacy, Inbox, Chat, Connections, Search Overlay, Notifications, Comments, Create Event, Create Story, Database Settings, API Settings, Help & Support, About) are currently realized as routed modals/screens under `app/` (e.g., `app/subscription.tsx`, `app/rankings.tsx`, `app/themes.tsx`, etc.) and not as reusable sheet components. They still require feature-complete UIs to match the prototype.

Notes:
- Each sheet uses BottomSheet with: drag handle, collapsed 60vh and expanded 95vh via allowCollapse, scrollable content, and proper overlay behavior. Content will be filled in respective gaps (e.g., Rankings, Subscription, etc.).

**What's Needed (for full feature parity — tracked in other gaps):**
- Fill each sheet with its exact UI and data per prototype sections
- Hook actions to backend APIs where applicable

## 🧩 Backend Parity & Production Readiness Checklist

### API Contracts and Endpoints (align with prototype flows)
- Posts: media types (image/video/carousel/text), sale_details, visibility, tags, faculty filters, featured feed, trending, suggestions
- Comments: create/list, pagination, moderation flags, like counts
- Likes/Bookmarks: idempotent like/unlike, save/unsave endpoints; counters returned in payloads
- Shares/Deep links: create share, track clicks; return share_url for post/profile/event/product
- Stories: create (image/video/template), list, expire, views tracking
- Store: list items (filters: category, price sort, popular), get item, create item (premium), edit, delete; similar items and recommendations endpoints
- Cart/Orders: add/remove/update quantity; checkout initialize; order create; status transitions; delivery method & address; pricing
- Payments: subscription checkout (Paystack) init + webhook; store order payments; verification and error handling; secure reference IDs
- Subscriptions: plans, status, upgrade; gating seller features and rankings access
- Rankings: weekly/monthly leaderboards; scoring points mapping (like/comment/share/sale/feature); podium data; prize pool
- Events: list with filters (type/audience), create, join/leave, detail, capacity/full
- Faculties: list categories, stats, faculty feed; mapping of users to faculties
- Connections: follow/unfollow/connect/accept/decline/suggested; counts and mutuals
- Chats: list conversations, messages pagination, send/typing indicators; unread counts
- Notifications: list, unread counts, mark read; push token registration
- Search: posts/items/users/tags; sorting and pagination; server-side relevance
- Settings: profile update, avatar update (presigned uploads), privacy toggles, language/date/currency preferences

### DTOs and Validation
- Define typed request/response DTOs for every route; document required/optional fields and enums
- Enforce express-validator schemas; return consistent error shapes; include pagination meta
- Normalize identifiers (email/username/phone) like the prototype’s login rules

### Security & Prod Hardening
- Enforce required env vars in non-dev (JWT secrets, DB URLs, SendGrid/Twilio/Paystack)
- Tight CORS in prod (only raved.app domains); remove wildcard
- Reduce JSON body limits; isolate uploads to multer/presigned S3 and validate mime/size
- Rate limits per sensitive routes (auth, payments, comments, chats)
- Content moderation pipeline active; trust score adjustments
- Structured logging (pino/winston) and error correlation IDs

### Data & Migrations
- Replace runtime schema init with versioned migrations (Prisma/Knex/Flyway)
- Ensure required extensions (pgcrypto or uuid-ossp) enabled explicitly
- Seed scripts for dev parity (users/posts/store/events) consistent with prototype data
- Background jobs: weekly/monthly ranking resets and prize assignment; notification digests

### Realtime (Socket.IO)
- Authenticate handshake; throttle auth failures
- Standardize event names/payloads: new_message, user_typing, post_like, post_comment, notification, store_item_sold
- Room conventions: user:{id}, chat:{id}; rejoin after token refresh
- Backpressure and rate limiting for send_message/typing

### Internationalization & Privacy
- i18n locales for en, fr, tw, ha; Accept-Language handling; translation coverage check
- Respect analytics/personalized-ads toggles server-side; do not store when disabled
- Data retention windows for analytics/PII; GDPR deletion flow

### Domain & Environment Alignment
- Single canonical API domain (api.raved.app or api.raved.com) across backend and app
- Mobile dev base URL strategy (iOS: localhost, Android: 10.0.2.2) with EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL override

### Payments
- Paystack integration: initialize, verify, webhooks; secure signature validation; retry logic
- Subscription state machine (trial → premium → expired); reconcile on webhook
- Order payments and refunds; receipt emails/SMS

### Media & Uploads
- Presigned upload endpoints; image processing (size/format); video constraints; CDN caching headers
- Anti-abuse: type sniffing, content scanning hooks

### Observability & Ops

## Database Partitioning & Consistency Plan

Authoritative stores by entity (single source of truth):
- MongoDB (authoritative for unstructured social content): posts, comments, likes, notifications. Reason: document-style payloads, flexible media fields, rapid iteration, and existing Mongoose models and queries (feed/trending/suggestions) are already stable here.
- PostgreSQL (authoritative for relational/transactional domains): users/identity, connections/follows, conversations/messages (if needed), store_items, cart, orders, subscriptions, rankings/scores, device_tokens, settings/privacy, events/attendees, shares. Reason: relational integrity, constraints, and analytics.
- Redis: cache (post counters, leaderboards), rate limits, ephemeral queues (offline sync), feature flags.

Current code alignment (no migration needed for core content):
- posts.controller writes/read posts/comments/likes in MongoDB and enriches with PostgreSQL users and other relational data; this is the target state for social entities.
- We added a direct mapping from sale posts → store_items via saleDetails.storeItemId, bridging Mongo (post) to PG (store) without duplication.

Decisions and refactor tasks:
1) Keep MongoDB as source of truth for posts/comments/likes/notifications.
   - Remove any temptation to duplicate core content structures in PostgreSQL. Use PG only for relational cross-cuts (e.g., shares table) and joins.
   - Ensure indices on Mongo collections (userId, createdAt, visibility, faculty, tags, likesCount, savesCount) to sustain feeds.

2) Standardize DTOs across endpoints.
   - All post list endpoints return: { id, user { avatar }, caption, media { type,url,thumbnail,items }, tags, likes, comments, shares, timeAgo, forSale, price, saleDetails?.storeItemId }.
   - Trending/Suggestions endpoints are already normalized; keep it consistent.

3) Caching strategy.
   - Use Redis keys: feed:user:{id}:page:{n}, post:{id}:counts, rankings:{period}.
   - TTLs: feed 5–10m, counts 1–2m, rankings 5m; invalidate on write via pub/sub.

4) Concurrency and consistency.
   - Idempotent writes for likes/saves in Mongo (unique (userId,targetId,targetType)). For PG cross-writes (e.g., shares), use ON CONFLICT.
   - Transactions on PG side for multi-table operations (e.g., create post (Mongo) + create store_item (PG) is now linked via storeItemId).

5) Cleanup plan.
   - Backfill sale posts missing saleDetails.storeItemId by scanning store_items (seller_id + recent name/price) and updating Post docs.
   - Add queryable index on saleDetails.storeItemId in Mongo for direct lookups.

Status notes for Sprint 1:
- DTOs standardized and FE normalization added for safety. Sale posts now include storeItemId for direct navigation to products.
